# Conceptual Investigation of Alternative Electric Ducted Fan Architectures - VALIDATION

This folder contains the sources and data, together with some results, of the validation exercise undertaken in this thesis.

The core validation has been done against the X22A 3-bladed ducted propeller engine, for which geometry and experimental test results are given in NASA-TN-D-4142.

An uncompleted further validation case against the TU Delft XPROP 6-bladed propeller is contained in the appropriately named subfolder as well. This case has not been finished, as issues with the representation of the camber line near the root section caused issues. These files are maintained for reference in case future validation efforts are to be undertaken.
