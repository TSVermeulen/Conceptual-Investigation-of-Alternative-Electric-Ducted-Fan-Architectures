# Conceptual Investigation of Alternative Electric Ducted Fan Architectures - XPROP VALIDATION

This folder contains the Python file, Excel spreadsheet, and airfoil .dat files for the TUD XPROP.
It should be noted that this validation case has not been finalised/completed.
At time of writing, there were some issues with the shape of the camber distribution of the profiles near the root, which were poorly represented by the developed code.

The files are maintained in this folder for reference.
