"""
MTFLO_call
=============

Description
-----------
This module provides an interface to interact with the MTFLO executable from Python. 
It creates a subprocess for the MTFLO executable, loads in the input file tflow.xxx, 
and writes the output to the tdat.xxx data file for use within MTSOL. 

Classes
-------
MTFLO_call
    A class to handle the interface between Python and the MTFLO executable.

Examples
--------
>>> analysisName = "test_case"
>>> test = MTFLO_call(analysisName)
>>> test.caller()

Notes
-----
This module is designed to work with the MTFLO executable. Ensure that the executable and the input file, tflow.xxx, 
are present in the same directory as this Python file. When executing the file as a standalone, it uses the inputs 
and calls contained within the if __name__ == "__main__" section. This part also imports the time module to measure 
the time needed to perform each file generation call. This is beneficial in runtime optimization.

References
----------
The required input data, limitations, and structures are documented within the MTFLOW user manual:

Versioning
------
Author: T.S. Vermeulen
Email: T.S.Vermeulen@student.tudelft.nl
Student ID: 4995309
Version: 1.0.5

Changelog:
- V1.0: Initial working version
- V1.0.5: Cleaned up inputs, removing file_path and changing it to a constant. 
- V1.1: Added file status check to ensure that the file has been written before proceeding. Added stdinwrite function to clean up process interactions.
